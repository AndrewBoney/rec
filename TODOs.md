- ~~refactor from pytorch lightning to plain torch.~~
- ~~Add wandb logging. This should also enable storing and reusing the model, in a way where encoders (i.e. conversation of features into indexes) can also be reapplied to a new dataset for inference.~~ 
- ~~Right now in the YAML and CLI setup it assumes that retrieval and ranking have the same columns. I want to have the ability to do use different columns for retrieval and ranking.~~  
- ~~Implement alternative model architectures, e.g. combining embeddings with stacked + learned weightings.~~ 
- Add data prep script for h & m.
- Add better metrics incl. for explicit data e.g. movielens
- Ability to use text and image encoders for cols given in YAML / CLI, with use of an embedding model from HuggingFace.
- Sequential column processing. A few ways to do this. I want to read papers like GPTRec before getting into this. 
- Add labels to implicit data... need to first investigate what these labels should be / indicate. 
- adjust it so that imports follow my preferences (i.e. alias -> \n -> direct -> \n -> from (pip libs) -> \n -> from (local libs))
